<p>There’s a family/dining room that spills out to a covered terrace via sliding glass doors, a kitchen equipped with commercial-grade stainless appliances, and several breakfast nooks and entertainment spaces. Moreover, due to its history as two homes, the unit features two of almost everything — at least two living rooms, two dining rooms, and more.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">Less than one year after Rihanna splashed out $21 million to buy one of the greater L.A. area’s most expensive condos, the Barbadian music superstar has put the sky-high penthouse back up for sale, asking just a hair under $25 million. Located at The Century skyscraper near Century City’s bustling Wilshire Corridor, the penthouse spans the building’s entire 40th floor. With more than 9,000 square feet of living space, numerous bespoke touches and incredible views, the spread is worthy of any A-lister.</p>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">Rihanna reportedly never moved into her pricey penthouse and has been trying to unload the place off-market for the past few months; current listings reveal the place offers clearly staged interiors. The 36-year-old billionaire bought the condo last spring from&nbsp;Nick Molnar, the billionaire cofounder of tech company Afterpay, who himself had bought the place less than two years prior from the late Matthew Perry.</p>

</div>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">During his four-year ownership, the beloved&nbsp;<em>Friends</em>&nbsp;actor extensively customized the place with the help of architect&nbsp;<a href="https://scottjoycedesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Scott Joyce</a>&nbsp;and interior designer&nbsp;<a href="https://lmpagano.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LM Pagano</a>, and it doesn’t appear Molnar or Rihanna made any significant changes to Perry’s designs.</p>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">A private elevator landing opens into the condo’s entrance gallery, and guests will be wowed by the living room’s curvaceous wall of floor-to-ceiling windows flaunting skyline views. Dark brown hardwood floors flow into the dining room, which is serviced by an all-white kitchen with marble countertops, dual islands and premium appliances.</p>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">Also on the premises are a soundproof movie theater with velour couches and a master suite equipped with a curved bedroom, dual bespoke closets, dual bathrooms and its own private lounge. But the condo’s most impressive features are likely its four separate outdoor terraces, which face four different directions — north, south, east and west — and sport panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean, Catalina Island, Downtown L.A. skyscrapers, the San Gabriel mountains and even snowcapped Mount Baldy.</p>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">Other notable residents at The Century include&nbsp;Denzel Washington&nbsp;and reality TV stars&nbsp;Terry and Heather Dubrow. And then there’s Candy Spelling, whose famed two-floor penthouse lies just above Rihanna’s, spanning the 41st and 42nd floors of the building.</p>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">Completed circa 2010 and designed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ramsa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Robert A.M. Stern Architects</a>, The Century has been Century City’s premier residential skyscraper since its completion. Rihanna’s penthouse includes a hefty $8,814 in monthly HOA dues — for that, she receives a host of building’s best amenities, including four deeded parking spots in its underground garage, 24/7 concierge and security guards, access to an outdoor swimming pool and lush gardens, onsite storage facilities, an in-house restaurant, conference rooms and much more.</p>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">Rihanna also owns another smaller condo at The Century, but her current main residence is a $14 million mansion in the mountains above Beverly Hills. According to Forbes, the&nbsp;<em>We Found Love</em>&nbsp;hitmaker is now the world’s richest female musician, with a $1.4 billion&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/rihanna/?sh=5788ff711400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">net worth</a>.</p>

The dining room, plenty large enough to accommodate two large tables, spills out through floor-to-ceiling glass to a terrace planted with olive trees, while the kitchen provides a 13-foot island for serving and snacking, along with an array of professional-grade Miele appliances.</p>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">The primary bedroom is a sumptuous retreat with a sitting area that showcases a massive Verner Panton Capiz shell chandelier and bespoke lace and cashmere drapery. Other pampering luxuries within the sprawling suite include a private dining space, an onyx bathroom, and a spacious dressing room with mirrored wardrobes. A built-in shampoo chair means never having to drive to the beauty salon.</p>

In addition to an attended lobby and valet parking, a private spa, and a fitness room, there’s private wine storage, a screening room, a private dining room, a resort-style pool, and several acres of manicured gardens. The property has guarded entrance gates and is patrolled for additional security.</p>

Walters had the 13.5-acre spread on and off the market for about three years starting in 2016, with asking prices that started out at a high of $85 million and dipped to a low of $48 million, but took it off the market before embarking on an extensive renovation.</p>

<p>Purchased as raw space, Walters had the condo decked out by Matthew Boland of&nbsp;<a class="link " href="https://www.mmbstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ylk="slk:MMB Studio;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">MMB Studio</a>&nbsp;in a style that shimmers with cosmopolitan opulence. Among the customizations is a heavy-duty HVAC system that keeps the whole place chilled to around 60 degrees so that the fresh flowers stay fresh longer. And in the foyer, where the ceiling glows with 22-carat gold leafing, an array of leaf-shaped Lalique light fixtures that adorn the glossy fumed Eucalyptus wood walls automatically light up when the elevator arrives.</p>

<p>In the Macassar-paneled living room, two 11-foot projector screens scroll down from the ceiling, and the back-lit onyx wall behind the wet bar slides open to reveal a flat-screen TV. The dining room, plenty large enough to accommodate two large tables, spills out through floor-to-ceiling glass to a terrace planted with olive trees, while the kitchen provides a 13-foot island for serving and snacking, along with an array of professional-grade Miele appliances.</p>
<p>The primary bedroom is a sumptuous retreat with a sitting area that showcases a massive Verner Panton Capiz shell chandelier and bespoke lace and cashmere drapery. Other pampering luxuries within the sprawling suite include a private dining space, an onyx bathroom, and a spacious dressing room with mirrored wardrobes. A built-in shampoo chair means never having to drive to the beauty salon.</p>

<p>By far the most expensive condo currently available on the open market in Los Angeles, the full-floor spread on the 39th floor&nbsp;of the Robert A.M. Stern-designed Century tower in Century City is on target to obliterate the standing record for the highest amount ever paid for a condo in Los Angeles, which is the $34.8 million Candy Spelling paid for her supersized duplex penthouse directly upstairs back in 2010.</p>

Said to be briefly occupied in the 1940s by Lana Turner, once owned by “All in the Family” star Jean Stapleton and later by late philanthropist Nancy Daly, the clapboard-clad and black-shuttered East Coast traditional was acquired by the 12-time Emmy nominated “American Idol” producer and “So You Can Dance” creator almost a decade ago for close to $7.5 million. Listings held by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.elliman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Douglas Elliman</a>’s&nbsp;<a href="https://saturnova.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Bachir Oueida</a>&nbsp;show there are a total of five bedrooms and seven bathrooms across the nearly three-quarter-acre spread that sits down a tiny cul-de-sac where it overlooks the tennis courts and Bentley-filled parking lot of the ritzy Bel-Air Country Club.</p>
<p>Sophisticated and elegantly proportioned formal living and dining rooms both have a fireplace, and the all-white, chef-accommodating eat-in kitchen is arranged around a huge island topped by a thick and lustrous slab of wood. There’s also a paneled library and a family room, both also with fireplaces. In addition to a staff bedroom and bathroom on the main floor, the main house’s second floor has two en suite guest bedrooms and an expansive master suite replete with yet another fireplace plus two marble bathrooms and a fitted dressing hall lined with glitzy, mirrored wardrobes. A two-story guesthouse adds a living room, bedroom and bath.</p>
<p>Outside, a trellised dining terrace with TV-surmounted brick fireplace looks out over the city beyond a grassy yard and swimming pool. And, below the backyard, the lushly landscaped hillside is laced with pathways that wind around a garden pavilion and a red, kitchy-classic&nbsp; London telephone booth.</p>

						<p>There’s living high on the hog, and then there’s taking things to ridiculous new levels of luxury.</p>
<p>Tradition-bucking, convenience-obsessed one-percenters are forgoing the purchase of sprawling Malibu estates and McMansions in gated communities. Instead they’re leasing swank apartments in towering, amenities-packed buildings.</p>
<p>The current epicenter of the trend is&nbsp;Ten Thousand—aka the 10K building—a 40-story edifice on the border of Beverly Hills and Century City at 10000 Santa Monica Boulevard where rents start at $10,000 and go up, up, and up to $65,000. Why own property when you can pay by the month and enjoy out-of-this-world perks, from robot butlers to a Rolls-Royce Phantom that will ferry you home after one too many drinks.</p>

</figure>
<p>“It’s a four-star prestige-hotel experience that isn’t a hotel,” says Scott Segall, a top Douglas Elliman/Fredrik Eklund real estate agent who works with the megarich but doesn’t have business dealings with the property. “It has unobstructed views in every direction. It has everything. It’s the place you go when you get caught cheating on your spouse and don’t have time to pack anything. Or you’re an heiress fresh out of rehab.”</p>
<p>The 283-unit building opened to a torrent of publicity in 2017 with more than 2,000 people on the wait list, according to the developer, Crescent Heights. “Our occupancy remains record-breaking,” says Jennifer Monir, the company’s regional director of business development. Current residents include pop star Demi Lovato; LeBron James’s business partner Maverick Carter; Magic Johnson’s son E.J.; and the recently indicted attorney Michael Avenatti, who’s known to wander through the building yelling loudly on his cellphone.</p>
<p>“It really is the 2020 equivalent of&nbsp;<em>Melrose Place</em>,” says one tenant, who like all residents we spoke to asked to remain anonymous for fear of upsetting their neighbors.</p>
<p>But unlike the ’90s drama’s sexy WeHo creatives and blue-collar types, the cast of 10K is of a different caste. The youngest residents tend to be college kids from the Middle East and Asia. “I have many friends who’ve installed their kids going to USC and UCLA there,” says one wealthy Beverly Hills business owner. “Many from Saudi Arabia, Dubai, Hong Kong, China. The building is well known in international business circles.” It’s also home to Saudi and Qatari princes, Russian oligarchs, and Chinese industrialists who are regularly seen trotting across the park with security teams in tow.</p>
<p>Then there are the “billski bros,” which one resident describes as “young urban professional douche bags constantly yammering about selling their companies for ‘big billski’ in the elevator.” Other common species in the building are thirsty divorced dads who dress too young for their age and prowl the building’s game room in search of company; energetic empty nesters looking for fun after selling their Brentwood mansions; and dog-loving dowagers who push their elderly pugs in Bugaboo strollers around the building’s one-acre private park.</p>
<p>“It’s surprisingly diverse,” says one tenant, “a very diverse group of very rich people.”</p>

<p>The apartments themselves, which come furnished or unfurnished, are also a varied bunch. They range from two-bedroom, 2½-bath residences with Bosch appliances for $10,000 a month to a $65,000, 4,000-square-foot penthouse with two terraces and a private deck. A dizzying array of building amenities are available to all residents. A complimentary breakfast is provided daily, and lunch and dinner are provided at an extra cost. There’s a mammoth gym that one particularly buff resident says “makes Equinox seem like 24 Hour Fitness” and not one but two pools: a 75-foot indoor one just for laps and an elaborate outdoor swimmer lined with cabanas. The house Rolls chauffeurs residents on shopping trips to Rodeo Drive or picks them up from a bar when they’re drunk. Tenants use an app-based valet service to have their own cars detailed or fueled before their feet touch the lobby’s gold-streaked Italian travertine floor or to request a macchiato be waiting for them when they get home. There are also indoor and outdoor movie theaters, a tennis court, a 2,000-square-foot dog run, a game room with a wet bar, and an elaborate, Eames-inspired kids’ studio. A staff of more than 80 sees to residents’ every wish, from dealing with dry cleaning to booking last-minute Botox appointments.</p>
<p>“We have created that large-home environment without the hassle of ownership and daily management,” says Monir.</p>
<p>And when human hands aren’t enough, there’s a robot named Charley, who resembles R2-D2 from&nbsp;<em>Star Wars</em>. It delivers meals, packages and suffers the occasional technical glitch. One tenant waiting on Charley to bring something to his place found the automaton “running repeatedly into a wall like some sad, busted Roomba.”</p>
<p>Security is, as one would expect, tight. There’s a 24-7 patrol, destination elevators that only go to floors you’re approved for, and back entrances for residents in need of more privacy. But, Monir says, rumors that they have Israeli intelligence officers on staff are untrue. “Ten Thousand is very secure. But no, no Mossad members to date,” she says with a laugh.</p>
<p>The sky-high luxe high-rise trend isn’t limited to L.A. Such buildings have been popular overseas for years, and Crescent Heights has built a 10K lookalike in Chicago called NEMA. The company is also developing similar properties in South Beach, Dallas, and New York.</p>
<p>And while Crescent Heights claims to have kicked off the caviar lease trend,&nbsp;<em>Apartment Guide&nbsp;</em>magazine’s managing director, Brian Carberry, says it won’t be the last. “Competitors are following suit in major metropolitan areas,” he says. “Seattle has an amenity-rich property called Kiara that recently opened with units renting as high as 18K.”</p>
<p>Developers are making a multibillion-dollar bet that rich people will be willing to fork over great sums of money for much less space and greater convenience.</p>
<p>“Time has become the world’s most valuable resource,” says Monir. “The amount of time you save living here is surreal.”</p>

<div class="blog-text">
<p>When Howard Gleicher, a resident of the Orange County suburbs, decided to buy a four bedroom condominium in The Century, it was with a long-term plan in mind. Sure, the investment manager needed an immediate crash pad in Los Angeles to manage the increasing amount of time work was requiring he spend there; but he also wanted an apartment that would be big enough and luxurious enough to eventually move in full-time.</p>
<p>“I decided I needed to get ahead of the trend that I’m seeing, which is more people moving not only back into cities but into multifamily dwellings,” says Gleicher. “It’s because of the services they provide, the ease of living, the security.”</p>
<p>The 42-story Century, one of several high-rise luxe apartment buildings&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/morganbrennan/2012/03/07/stephen-ross-the-billionaire-who-is-rebuilding-new-york/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer Related Cos</a>has constructed in the past five years, touts a star-architect lineage (Robert A.M. Stern designed it), a double-gated security entrance and amenities like outdoor fireplace-bedecked dining rooms, wine cellar storage, and a fitness area with spa. The development got instant buzz in 2007 when Candy Spelling, wife of late TV producer Aaron Spelling and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/morganbrennan/2011/07/14/its-official-americas-most-expensive-home-has-a-brand-new-billionaire-owner/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">former owner of the $85 million Manor</a>, snapped up a 15,600-square foot, $35 million penthouse – the most ever spent on a condo in Los Angeles.</p>
<p>“<a href="http://www.forbes.com/security/">Security</a>&nbsp;and privacy are the biggest requests from my clients,” says Bachir Oueida, president of L.A.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.forbes.com/real-estate/">Real Estate</a>. He currently represents two units under contract in the building. “They don’t want to worry about finding someone trustworthy to take care of the garden or that somebody could jump the fence.” He says his biggest condo clients fall under one of two categories: wealthy international buyers in need of a pied-a-terre and single family homeowners looking for less hassle.</p>
<p>Gleicher joins an array of homeowners (like Spelling and Oueida’s clients), real estate experts and billionaire developers who believe luxury apartment living is the more secure, more convenient trend of the future. “That’s where the action has been,” says Jonathan Miller, chief executive of Miller Samuel Inc, a New York City-based real estate appraisal firm. “It [the ultra high-end apartment market] seems to have more of a higher concentration of activity,” especially in major metro areas like New York City. Miller tracks housing market activity in urban areas that include New York, Miami, and Washington D.C.</p>
<p>In Manhattan, a market dominated by condo and co-op properties (townhouses make up a mere 2% of activity), 2010 and 2011 saw more sales for three and four-bedroom apartments than any other years in the decade proceeding them, according to data&nbsp;<a href="http://www.millersamuel.com/reports/elliman-report-manhattan-decade-2002-2011" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">from Miller Samuel and Prudential Douglas Elliman</a>. In other words, homebuyers have been picking up large units in high rises, opting for city dwelling over the more traditional suburban, standalone home experience that has defines Westchester County and Long Island.</p>
<p>“People that used to think city living was too edgy, consider it to be an extremely safe environment now,” says Gary Malin, president of Citi Habitats, a New York City-based realty firm. In conjunction with Corcoran Sunshine Marketing Group, Malin’s firm represents new luxury high rises like The Aldyn on Manhattain’s Upper West Side,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3gnAFocsR60&amp;feature=plcp&amp;context=C4842e78VDvjVQa1PpcFOQjvRmJrfBHqUVd0INZ3GzUP5kRxq8HFM=" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">that cater to families with larger layouts and kid-friendly amenities like a bowling alley</a>. “I think that they feel the conveniences outweigh the commuting time that would otherwise be spent.” So as more high rises dapple city skylines, more humongous apartments become available.</p>
<p>Sorting through thousands of high-rise condo and co-op listings from around the U.S., we picked out the most opulently adorned and the most spacious offerings, ranging in size from 4,000 to 17,000 square feet. Every property has a price tag of more than a million dollars, and each sits atop a tall, amenity-laden multi-family building.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.sothebysrealty.com/eng" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sotheby’s International Realty</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.coldwellbanker.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coldwell Banker Previews International</a>, the&nbsp;<a href="http://www.corcoran.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Corcoran Group</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.realtor.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Realtor.com</a>,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.zillow.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zillow.com</a>, and others helped us compile our list.</p>
<p>The biggest apartment on our list is a $35 million penthouse apartment in Miami, Fla.’s Continuum South Tower. The palatial 11,031 square-foot pad spans four levels overlooking Miami Beach and the surrounding city.&nbsp; It boasts separate a separate, detached guest loft and an additional 6,000 square feet of outdoor space that includes a sundeck and a private pool.</p>
<p>Another established Miami building, Acqualina, is known for its five-diamond boutique hotel and posh apartments overlooking the Sunny Isles beaches. But the Trump Group now plans to roll out an additional tower housing 79 mega condos referred to as “sky mansions.”&nbsp; Ranging in size from 4,600 square feet up, the “mansions” will boast full outdoor kitchens and private custom outdoor hot tubs. The biggest unit – priced at a staggering $50 million — will encompass 16,000 square feet that includes seven bedrooms, a 25-foot home theater, a library, a private pool, and a hot tub with massaging waterfall.</p>
<p>“We have people interested in that penthouse,” says Michael Goldstein, Acqualina’s director of sales. “It’s a house. It’s like having your backyard and your front yard but they are 65 stories up – literally.” He’s probably not exaggerating. The most expensive condo sale in Miami ever was the Setai penthouse in December for $21.5 million, or $3704 per-square-foot.</p>

<div class="blog-text">
<p>Seven years ago when the housing bubble burst, it nearly took down Wall Street and the entire U.S. economy.</p>
<p>This week, the concern was the reverse: That the prospect of an extended dive in the stock market, or even continued volatility, might spook buyers and sellers in Southern California’s housing market — just as it has finally normalized after a bust-and-boom cycle.</p>
<p>Blaring headlines about the three-digit swings in the Dow Jones industrial average weighed on buyers such as Christian Lander, a television writer and author, who put an offer on a Glendale house last week, before the stock market started falling. He’s proceeding as planned, because he’s investing for the long term and doesn’t want to react to fluctuations in the market.</p>
<p>But Lander worries that other buyers may take a different view — because he’s a seller too, looking to unload his two-bedroom condo in Koreatown.</p>
<p>“I am just hoping it won’t freak people out that this is a bad time to buy,” he said.</p>
<p>So far Lander’s decision to press ahead is typical of what local real estate agents and mortgage brokers say they have seen in the housing market, though the unease already has prompted some price cuts. But if the Wall Street gyrations continue for a prolonged period, say for weeks, economists believe that the uncertainty could cause a shift in housing market sentiment.</p>
<p>And there’s another threat: Much of the blame for the stock market turmoil has been on the weakening economy in China, where investors flush with cash have become the largest source of overseas buyers for Southern California residential real estate.</p>
<p>“One or two days makes people nervous and glued to the TV, but it doesn’t necessarily change a life-altering purchase such as a home,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel Fixed Income. “If there’s ongoing uncertainty, consumers will pull back.”</p>
<p>George Pagano, a real estate agent with Immel Team Luxury Real Estate who specializes in coastal south Orange County, said his buyers are assuming that the stock drop-off is temporary and are not changing their intentions.</p>
<p>But some sellers have been more willing to trim their asking prices from levels he considered unrealistic. This week, the owners of a five-bedroom house in Laguna Niguel reduced their asking price by $505,000, down to $3.9 million.</p>
<p>“They are taking our advice to lower their expectations,” he said.</p>
<p>Laguna Niguel mortgage broker Jeff Lazerson said he hasn’t heard from worried borrowers, but he dislikes the volatility and is hoping that the stock market doesn’t go into a steep decline.</p>
<p>“The best things in real estate are no whipsaws — slow and steady growth and there are no distractions for the consumer,” he said.</p>
<p>Where can you afford to live?</p>
<p>The recent drops in the stock market have been largely driven by concerns over China’s slowing economy, worries that have been heightened by a sharp sell-off in that country’s stock market and a devaluation of its currency.</p>
<p>Economists said slowing growth abroad could go two ways. It could sap demand from markets such as Irvine and the San Gabriel Valley, which Chinese families have poured into in recent years, seeking good school districts and a safe place to park their cash. Or it could increase investments as wealthy individuals look to get their money out of China and into the U.S.</p>
<p>John Burns, an Irvine consultant for home-building companies, said one of his clients has seen fewer Chinese buyers shopping for homes at its Southern California communities over the last month. And another client told him that a buyer canceled a deal recently because of the buyer’s losses in the Chinese stock market.</p>
<p>“Clearly, there is some uncertainty out there,” he said.</p>
<p>Tom Berge Jr., president of the West San Gabriel Valley Assn. of Realtors, has had a different experience. He said three or four Chinese business owners looking to invest in homes have raised concerns to him over economic turmoil in China. But it wasn’t because they might no longer be able to afford local real estate.</p>
<p>“Their fear is the government is going to limit the money that can freely move out of China,” he said.</p>
<p>Christopher Thornberg, founding partner of Beacon Economics, believes that slowing growth abroad won’t slow investment because Chinese residents will become more inclined to move money into what they consider a safe investment.</p>
<p>“If anything, this is only going to intensify the push to get money out of China,” he said.</p>

<p>The volatility on Wall Street comes just as home buyers were growing more confident. In July, home sales in Southern California hit a nine-year high and prices rose 5.5% from a year earlier to a median price of $438,000 as the U.S. economy continued its long recovery in a low-interest-rate environment.</p>
<p>Scott Laurie, chief executive of Olson Homes, said he’s encouraged by strong job growth within California, so his Seal Beach development company is moving ahead with at least eight new single-family and town-home communities on which it plans to break ground next year.</p>
<p>“A [stock market] correction of 10% to 20% doesn’t change that,” he said. “We have a full pipeline in place for next year. We are pretty bullish.”</p>
<p>Stuart Gabriel, director of UCLA’s Ziman Center for Real Estate, is also bullish on housing.</p>
<p>He said the stock market volatility shouldn’t change the housing market’s upward trajectory, noting the recent drops in the stock market have been driven by worries over economies abroad while the fundamentals of the U.S. economy remain strong.</p>
<p>“At this moment demand for housing remains roughly intact,” Gabriel said. “There is nothing about what we’re seeing in the last few days that would change that assessment.”</p>
<p>Indeed, by the end of the week, the stock market had calmed, with the Dow recovering substantial ground. Still, few people on Wall Street think that all the turbulence is a thing of the past.</p>
<p>Michael Novati, a 28-year-old technology worker in San Francisco, said he wasn’t letting the market volatility affect his plans to buy a condo on L.A.’s Westside as an investment and a home for his brother.</p>
<p>Novati has been looking for six months, and during that stretch his biggest obstacle has been his desire to find just the right condo in a market with very limited options. That remained his biggest issue as he forged ahead this week despite all the unnerving news.</p>
<p>“You got to suck it up” and think about the long term, he said.</p>

<div class="blog-text">
<p>When, as the holiday lyrics have it, “the weather outside is frightful,” that makes it a good time to start planning the coming year’s home improvement projects. If you wait for ideal weather conditions to begin laying out your plans, you’re likely to wind up well behind schedule before you even start.</p>
<p>If the home improvements you are contemplating can be handled by yourself, you are probably a Do-It-Yourselfer who knows that you’ll need your ducks in a row before you pull the first nail or make the first cut. Having plans drawn and materials at the ready saves time and work (but you know that).</p>
<p>Should the scope of your contemplated home improvements go beyond the DIY approach, if you have experience in overseeing similar projects in the past, you know how important it is to hire the right tradespeople. True Beverly Hills crafts professionals are perpetually in demand not only because of their skills but because of that demand. It means that they don’t create more work than is necessary or stretch out a project to fill their week—their week is already spoken for (and the weeks after, too!). The issue is more that of reserving sufficient time for any given project. A corollary is that the more experience Beverly Hills tradespeople have under their belts, the more skilled they are at accurately projecting time requirements.</p>
<p>If you haven’t tackled any major home improvement projects before—or even if you have, if your own time is fully committed elsewhere—finding the right Beverly Hills contractor to shepherd your job is all-important. The best Beverly Hills contractors can be scheduled well in advance, so if weather factors into your initiative, winter is the ideal time to get planning underway.</p>
<p>How to find the right Beverly Hills contractor follows some familiar action steps—</p>
<p>Gather recommendations from friends with success stories and from experienced Beverly Hills real estate professionals (like me, of course!)<br>
Call the likely candidates. A phone interview should provide you with a preliminary impression and a list of past clients you can contact<br>
Meet the few who make your short list. Discuss the scope of the job; request preliminary cost and time estimates<br>
After you make your decision, make sure scope and schedule are in writing—including bonus payments (it’s sometimes a good idea) and penalties. One thing to always keep in mind is that some of the most expensive words in the English language are “while you’re at it.”<br>
Of course, a fast way to get started is to contact me in that first action item. We can discuss a short list of Beverly Hills’s best contractors—as well as some go-to tradespeople who have proven their value to my clients in the past. As with all your Beverly Hills real estate questions, we’re always happy to help!</p>

<p>In many of the fancier neighborhoods throughout Los Angeles, median housing prices have been rising and reaching new highs. But in the last three months of 2015, there was one neighborhood that did a much more brisk luxury real estate business than the rest: Pacific Palisades. The most recent LA market update from Sotheby’s International Realty shows the coastal ‘hood saw a 133-percent increase in sales of houses over $3 million compared to those in the same quarter of 2014. The final quarter of 2015 saw 28 residences over $3 million sold in the neighborhood—a robust rise from the 12 sold in the last three months of 2014.</p>
<p>Explaining Pac Pal’s rise to greatness, the executive vice president/chief operating officer of Sotheby’s International Realty said in a release that the hotness might have something to with the ongoing plans of The Grove developer Rick Caruso to remake Palisades Village (the neighborhood’s quaint retail district), as well as more attention from investors to the area. Pacific Palisades also did a brisk business over the summer, when it had the most total luxury sales in the LA area for the period.<br>
LA-area markets with greatest increases in luxury houses sold.</p>
<p>Pacific Palisades might have seen the most sales, but in terms of priciest houses, they’re not even on the list. Malibu Beach took that honor, with fancy estates sold in the final quarter of 2015 averaging $9,842,857. Malibu Beach even beat out Bel Air and Holmby Hills, where the average was $8,649,818.</p>

<p>Movie star Burt Lancaster had a condominium in Century City, as did Ruth and Elliot Handler, co-founders of the Mattel toy company. Ronald Reagan, while he was president, maintained his “Western White House” there. Today, celebrities including actor Matthew Perry and chef Nobu Matsuhisa look over Los Angeles from their Century City properties in the sky.</p>
<p>For most, luxury living in Los Angeles evokes visions of sprawling estates. But since the 1960s, Century City has offered an alternative, exemplifying each decade’s notion of the ultimate in high-rise living. Today, with billions of dollars of investment coming to the area, developers are attempting to sell Century City’s glamorous past even as they launch new properties with lavish amenities, views and prices.</p>
<p>“My grandparents saw the apartment and bought it on the spot,” said Joshua Flagg, of the late Edith and Eric Flagg, who purchased a penthouse in Century Towers in 1976. Ms. Flagg was a Holocaust survivor and fashion designer whose eponymous company made women’s sportswear. Mr. Flagg, today estate homes director of Rodeo Realty in Beverly Hills, said he grew up visiting the building and remembers neighbors like the Handlers.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="blog-img" src="/images/blogs/18-2.jpg" alt="unnamed" width="" height=""></p>
<p>Century City, a roughly 180-acre neighborhood between Beverly Hills and Santa Monica, was designed in the 1960s as a showcase for high-rise construction and modern, urban living. In 1960, movie studio 20th Century Fox sold land used as back lots for movie sets to the Aluminum Company of America , now two companies, Alcoa and Arconic.</p>
<p>Alcoa wanted to demonstrate aluminum’s utility in high-rise construction, according to a book about the area from 1959 to 2009, published by the Century City Chamber of Commerce. The goal, the book said, was a “glimmering Alcoa showpiece,” with high-rise office and residential buildings, wide boulevards, pedestrian bridges and landscaped plazas, which is precisely how Century City looks today. There are 21 office high-rises and five residential high rises today, said Nancy Wood, Chamber president.</p>
<p>Alcoa’s first residential high rises, the two Century Towers, were completed in 1964. Designed by architect I.M. Pei, the towers attracted people with their proximity to the Hillcrest Country Club and amenities such as a pool, gym and tennis court. Over the years, many entertainers, including singer Karen Carpenter, actor Michael Douglas and David Janssen, star of the 1960s television show “The Fugitive,” lived there. Mr. Janssen’s widow, Dani, lives in the building to this day, she confirmed.</p>
<p>Burt Lancaster, who died in 1994, purchased two units in 1974 and combined them, according to records provided by Orange Coast Title Company. He hired architect Hal Levitt to design the property in Moroccan style, said Diana Cook, president of California Dreaming Realty, who is listing it as a $7,850-a-month rental.</p>
<p>The current owner, investor Michael Rosen, put the property on the market last year for $2.995 million. After it failed to sell following a price reduction to $2.65 million, he decided to rent it for a year or two, Mr. Rosen said, adding that he never altered Mr. Lancaster’s finishes.</p>
<p>In the 1980s, President Ronald Reagan lent glamour and power to Century City by frequently staying at the Century Plaza Hotel, part of which later became the St. Regis Hotel, said Joanne Drake, chief administrative officer at the Reagan Foundation. He hosted his two victory parties at the Century Plaza, which the press dubbed the “Western White House,” said Ms. Drake.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="blog-img" src="/images/blogs/18-3.jpg" alt="unnamed-2"></p>
<p>In 2005, the St. Regis was purchased by the Related Companies, a New York-based developer, which tore it down and put up the Century, completed in 2010.</p>
<p>Sales, which commenced at the height of the real-estate crisis, were initially slow. In addition, Mary Ann Osborn, who was the director of sales for the Century when it opened, said buyers were so nervous about high-rise living she saw some of them 12 or 14 times before they made an offer.</p>
<p>Some early buyers in the building have now seen their investments nearly double, said Bachir Oueida of Douglas Elliman, who said he has sold 24 units and rented out 14 in the building. Last year, Mr. Oueida listed a 9,300-square-foot penthouse; it sold in June to the actor Matthew Perry for $20 million, according to people familiar with the transaction. Representatives for Mr. Perry declined to comment.</p>
<p>Candy Spelling, widow of television producer Aaron Spelling, lives in an 18,000-square-foot duplex penthouse. She paid $34.8 million in 2010, according to public records.</p>
<p>Commercial real-estate executive Gary Weiss, 60, and his wife, Tari, 57, a software-company founder, moved from a large home in the San Fernando Valley to the Century in 2014. They paid $4.33 million for a 3,250-square-foot unit, which they renovated.</p>
<p>The Weisses walk their Maltese, Chloe, to Beverly Hills, and stroll Century City for shopping and dining. Mr. Weiss eats a couple of times a week at the Century’s ground-floor restaurant, Hinoki &amp; the Bird. At lunch, three-quarters of the clientele are talent agents at Creative Artists Agency, which is around the corner, said the restaurant’s manager Chris Cutjapan. Their typical order: kale salad with salmon, he said.</p>
<p>From their apartment, the Weisses look out onto the site of the future Century Plaza Hotel Residences and Tower Residences, a redevelopment of the Century Plaza Hotel by developer Woodridge Capital Partners. The $2.5 billion project will include a 394-room Fairmont Hotel, which will also house 63 condos. Behind the hotel will be two 43-story towers with a total of 268 condos, said Ms. Osborn, now managing director of sales and marketing for the residences. The project should be complete by mid-2021, and prices per square foot should exceed those at the Century, Ms. Osborn said. The Century runs at about $1,800 per square foot, said Mr. Oueida, which means a 1,000-square-foot unit at the Century Plaza would theoretically cost over $1.8 million.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="blog-img" src="/images/blogs/18-4.jpg" alt="unnamed-1"></p>
<p>Century City still suffers from a reputation for being a collection of cold skyscrapers lacking neighborhood amenities like public parks, street life and nightlife.</p>
<p>Westfield, one of the world’s largest shopping mall owners, has recently invested $1 billion in an effort to change that reputation. It is in the final stages of a redevelopment of its Century City Westfield Mall, originally built in the 1960s, said Bill Hecht, chief operating officer in the U.S.</p>
<p>The mall has “smart parking,” where cars are tracked and billed via their license plates, and private lounges; and will have a branch of Mario Batali’s Italian food market, Eataly.</p>
<p>Betting on growing acceptance of ultra-luxury vertical living, Miami-based developer Crescent Heights built and opened a 40-story rental building in January called Ten Thousand. Rents range from $9,000 to $65,000 per month said Jennifer Monir, regional director of business development. Ms. Monir said the building is “not fully leased but close.”</p>
<p>The building offers amenities including a robot “butler” named Charley that brings items up to the apartments, and resident-tracking beacons. As a resident moves toward the bar, for example, the bartender is alerted and can start mixing up their favorite dirty martini, Ms. Monir said.</p>

<div class="blog-text">
<p>Just as the stock market soared in 2017, rich and famous folk bought and sold residential properties coast to coast at dizzying, previously unheard of high prices. Indeed, Taylor Swift’s $18<br>
million acquisition of a downtown New York City townhouse and Matthew Perry’s $20<br>
million purchase of a mansion-size condo in L.A.’s Century City — it was listed by Bachir Oueida of Douglas Elliman — barely merit a mention on any short list of the year’s top celebrity sales. And though it may sound like an unimaginable amount of money to mere financial mortals, Angelina Jolie’s $24.5 million pickup of Hollywood pioneer Cecil B. DeMille’s Spanish colonial revival-style mansion in the gated Laughlin Park enclave in L.A.’s Los Feliz is but a fraction of the astronomical sums celebs spent or took in on their myriad real estate transactions over the past year.</p>
<p>George Lucas Buys Holmby Hills Estate</p>
<p>Shortly after he announced plans to spend a billion dollars to build the Lucas Museum of Narrative Art in downtown L.A.’s Exposition Park, “Star Wars” filmmaker George Lucas paid Texas billionaire H. Ross Perot $33.9 million for the Mi Patria estate in L.A.’s always fashionable and forbiddingly expensive Holmby Hills. Formerly owned by music industry mandarin Freddy DeMann, the not quite one-acre estate includes an elegant 1929 Spanish villa of almost 10,000 square feet with five bedrooms and eight bathrooms as well as an open-air cabana next to a mosaic-tiled swimming pool and staff quarters atop a detached two-car garage.</p>
<p>“Modern Family” co-creator and “LA to Vegas” executive producer Steve Levitan and his estranged wife, Krista, may be struggling through an acrimonious, tabloid-tracked divorce, but the erstwhile couple nonetheless brought home some serious bacon in the real estate department. Not only did they unload their former home in the low-key but high-toned Brentwood Park neighborhood on L.A.’s Westside for a bit below $9.8 million — the buyer was “Late Late Show” host James Corden — but they more notably sold a “modern farmhouse”-style mansion they custom-built on a high bluff overlooking the Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades, Calif., for an astonishing $41 million to Kevin Washington, the well-financed son of octogenarian Montana multibillionaire businessman Dennis Washington.</p>
<p>After two long years on the market with a preposterously optimistic asking price that started at a publicity-generating $75 million and dropped to a still pie-in-the-sky $59 million, Demi Moore, once upon a time the highest-paid actress in Hollywood, finally sold her triplex penthouse in the south tower of the handsome, twin-towered San Remo building on New York City’s Central Park West</p>
<p>for $45 million to an as-yet-unidentified buyer. Despite the sale figure being an embarrassing 40% discount off the original asking price, Moore is laughing all the way to the bank because it’s also nearly 6.5 times the $7 million she and ex-husband Bruce Willis paid renowned film and theater impresario Robert Stigwood for the six-bedroom and 5.5-bathroom park-view penthouse in 1990. Adam D. Modlin of the Modlin Group handled the listing.</p>
<p>David Geffen’s Sale Breaks Malibu Records</p>
<p>David Geffen, who presides over a residential property portfolio that easily exceeds $250 million in value, added to his more than $6 billion fortune with the record-shattering $87 million sale of his longtime compound on Malibu, Calif.’s prestigious Carbon Beach to Dodgers owner Mark Walter, while pals and business partners George Clooney and Rande Gerber, who made themselves a whole lot richer this year when they sold their Casamigos Tequila company for $1 billion, earned what is by comparison just petty cash when they sold side-by-side contemporary beachfront villas they custom- built in a posh guard-gated development near Baja California’s Cabo San Lucas to an unnamed Mexican billionaire in a combined deal reportedly valued at $100 million.</p>
<p>Among the year’s biggest — if not the biggest — spenders in the celebrity real estate arena were unquestionably showbiz’s reigning king and queen of just about everything, Jay-Z and Beyoncé, who shelled out a blood-freezing $114 million for two high-maintenance trophy homes, one in Los Angeles and the other in the Hamptons. Having shacked up for a few years in a series of high-priced rentals in some of L.A.’s most expensive zip codes, the peripatetic couple bit the real estate bullet and bought a brand-new, spec-built compound in a plum pocket of L.A.’s Bel-Air for which they took a gasp-worthy $52.8 million mortgage against an $88 million sale price. All together, the sleekly ostentatious contemporary compound comprises six glass-walled structures with eight bedrooms and 11 bathrooms plus staff quarters, along with more than 10,000 square feet of outdoor living areas, a regulation-sized basketball court, a comprehensive wellness center, garage space for 15 cars and four swimming pools. That’s right, there are four swimming pools.</p>
<p>Just months after they settled on a West Coast home, the mononymic bicoastal couple, who have long maintained a nearly 9,000-square-foot condo in lower Manhattan’s Tribeca neighborhood, coughed up about $25.9 million for a shingle-clad “cottage” on 2.1 acres that covetously borders Georgica Pond in the tony beach community of East Hampton, New York. In addition to the aristocratically proportioned main residence, which has five bedrooms and seven full and two half bathrooms in about 12,000 square feet, the secluded spread has a two-bedroom and one-bathroom guest cottage. There’s also an infinity-edged swimming pool set into a Turkish limestone-paved terrace that overlooks a great, verdant sweep of lawn that slopes gently down to the pond’s picturesque edge.</p>
<p>The Year Ahead</p>
<p>Looking at 2018, a number of entertainment industry powerhouses are poised to cash in on the sales of homes they’ve hung with astronomical price tags. Just in the latter half of 2017 alone, Ellen DeGeneres and Portia de Rossi coughed up $18.6 million for an oceanfront residence in Carpinteria, Calif., plus another $7.2 million for a hacienda-style compound in wildfire-threatened Montecito, but their expenditures will be more than covered if they get the $39.5 million they’re asking for a 13- plus-acre Santa Barbara, Calif., estate they bought in 2014 for not quite $29 million and first listed</p>
<p>at $45 million. Jennifer Lopez will likely turn a tidy profit on a 6,500-square-foot penthouse overlooking New York City’s Madison Square Park that she snagged in 2014 for a tetch more than $20 million and now has up for sale at $26.5 million. Adam D. Modlin of the Modlin Group handled the listing. And despite untold millions spent on costly upgrades and expansions, Gwen Stefani will no doubt see a hefty windfall when she sells her Kelly Wearstler-decorated seven-bedroom estate in the mountains between Beverly Hills and Studio City, Calif. — it was once owned by Lopez — that she and ex-husband Gavin Rossdale bought in 2006 for $13.25 million and have listed at $35 million.</p>
<p>In addition to the enviable gains realized from the sale of their Baja California getaway, Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber hope 2018 will at long last bring a deep-pocketed buyer to a bluff-top Malibu estate they bought as part of a two-parcel spread in early 2015 for $50.5 million. The unfairly comely couple, who reside in a neighboring beachfront property, split the estate in two, quickly renovated the existing 5,300-square-foot residence that sits on the larger three-plus-acre lot and re- listed it in late 2015 with a much too rosy $60 million price tag that after more than a year on the market now stands at $50 million.</p>
<p>Sting and Trudie Styler Sell in Manhattan<br>
It looks like rock ’n’ roll royals Sting and Trudie Styler will be 2018’s first big celebrity real estate winners when they just about double their money on the pending sale of a comfortably sumptuous duplex penthouse on New York City’s Upper West Side they bought in 2008 for $26.5 million.</p>
<p>The lavish-living couple, who own homes around the world, including a mansion in London and a 900-plus-acre vineyard estate in Italy’s Tuscany region, set the almost 5,500-square-foot penthouse out for sale in May 2017 at $56 million and now have it in contract to be sold for an amount widely rumored on the celebrity property gossip grapevine to be in the vicinity of $50 million.</p>

<p>The Westwood/Century City area owes much of its history to Edwin and Harold Sans, who not only sold the city the 375-acre plot of land that would become UCLA at a discounted rate in 1925 but also developed Westwood Village.</p>
<p>Students, families and celebrities all flocked to the city in the following decades, resulting in a housing shortage that’s seen the area grow vertically more than horizontally. Now, luxury condos attract some of the area’s most prominent residents.</p>
<p>In 2017, there were 14 combined single-family home and condominium sales of $5 million or more in the Westwood/Century City area, including a pair of deals north of $15 million. There were 139 transactions of $2 million or more last year, up from 137 the previous year.</p>
<p>The full-floor penthouse has more than 9,300 square feet of living space.</p>

<p>$20 million – West Century Drive</p>
<p>Four of the five most expensive real estate sales in Westwood/Century City last year involved the Century building, a 42-story luxury high-rise designed by Robert A.M. Stern Architects.</p>
<p>Topping the list was Matthew Perry’s July purchase of a full-floor unit in the building. The penthouse has more than 9,300 square feet of living space and wraparound terraces with views of the city, mountains and ocean.</p>
<p>Living spaces lined with floor-to-ceiling windows include a center-island kitchen and a formal dining room that seats 25.</p>
<p>The massive master suite features hardwood floors and multiple sitting areas.</p>
<p>Bachir Oueida of Douglas Elliman was the listing agent. Greg Holcomb of Pacific Union International represented the buyer.</p>

<p>There’s a family/dining room that spills out to a covered terrace via sliding glass doors, a kitchen equipped with commercial-grade stainless appliances, and several breakfast nooks and entertainment spaces. Moreover, due to its history as two homes, the unit features two of almost everything — at least two living rooms, two dining rooms, and more.</p>

      <div class="post-content">
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">Less than one year after Rihanna splashed out $21 million to buy one of the greater L.A. area’s most expensive condos, the Barbadian music superstar has put the sky-high penthouse back up for sale, asking just a hair under $25 million. Located at The Century skyscraper near Century City’s bustling Wilshire Corridor, the penthouse spans the building’s entire 40th floor. With more than 9,000 square feet of living space, numerous bespoke touches and incredible views, the spread is worthy of any A-lister.</p>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">Rihanna reportedly never moved into her pricey penthouse and has been trying to unload the place off-market for the past few months; current listings reveal the place offers clearly staged interiors. The 36-year-old billionaire bought the condo last spring from&nbsp;Nick Molnar, the billionaire cofounder of tech company Afterpay, who himself had bought the place less than two years prior from the late Matthew Perry.</p>

</div>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">During his four-year ownership, the beloved&nbsp;<em>Friends</em>&nbsp;actor extensively customized the place with the help of architect&nbsp;<a href="https://scottjoycedesign.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Scott Joyce</a>&nbsp;and interior designer&nbsp;<a href="https://lmpagano.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LM Pagano</a>, and it doesn’t appear Molnar or Rihanna made any significant changes to Perry’s designs.</p>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">A private elevator landing opens into the condo’s entrance gallery, and guests will be wowed by the living room’s curvaceous wall of floor-to-ceiling windows flaunting skyline views. Dark brown hardwood floors flow into the dining room, which is serviced by an all-white kitchen with marble countertops, dual islands and premium appliances.</p>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">Also on the premises are a soundproof movie theater with velour couches and a master suite equipped with a curved bedroom, dual bespoke closets, dual bathrooms and its own private lounge. But the condo’s most impressive features are likely its four separate outdoor terraces, which face four different directions — north, south, east and west — and sport panoramic views of the Pacific Ocean, Catalina Island, Downtown L.A. skyscrapers, the San Gabriel mountains and even snowcapped Mount Baldy.</p>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">Other notable residents at The Century include&nbsp;Denzel Washington&nbsp;and reality TV stars&nbsp;Terry and Heather Dubrow. And then there’s Candy Spelling, whose famed two-floor penthouse lies just above Rihanna’s, spanning the 41st and 42nd floors of the building.</p>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">Completed circa 2010 and designed by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ramsa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Robert A.M. Stern Architects</a>, The Century has been Century City’s premier residential skyscraper since its completion. Rihanna’s penthouse includes a hefty $8,814 in monthly HOA dues — for that, she receives a host of building’s best amenities, including four deeded parking spots in its underground garage, 24/7 concierge and security guards, access to an outdoor swimming pool and lush gardens, onsite storage facilities, an in-house restaurant, conference rooms and much more.</p>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto lrv-a-font-body-m ">Rihanna also owns another smaller condo at The Century, but her current main residence is a $14 million mansion in the mountains above Beverly Hills. According to Forbes, the&nbsp;<em>We Found Love</em>&nbsp;hitmaker is now the world’s richest female musician, with a $1.4 billion&nbsp;<a href="https://www.forbes.com/profile/rihanna/?sh=5788ff711400" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">net worth</a>.</p>

The dining room, plenty large enough to accommodate two large tables, spills out through floor-to-ceiling glass to a terrace planted with olive trees, while the kitchen provides a 13-foot island for serving and snacking, along with an array of professional-grade Miele appliances.</p>
<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">The primary bedroom is a sumptuous retreat with a sitting area that showcases a massive Verner Panton Capiz shell chandelier and bespoke lace and cashmere drapery. Other pampering luxuries within the sprawling suite include a private dining space, an onyx bathroom, and a spacious dressing room with mirrored wardrobes. A built-in shampoo chair means never having to drive to the beauty salon.</p>

<p class="paragraph larva // lrv-u-margin-lr-auto  lrv-a-font-body-m   ">Residents of The Century, who have included the late Matthew Perry, Rihanna, Denzel Washington, Paula Abdul, and restaurateur Nobu Matsuhisa, fork over hefty common charges for a long list of amenities. In addition to an attended lobby and valet parking, a private spa, and a fitness room, there’s private wine storage, a screening room, a private dining room, a resort-style pool, and several acres of manicured gardens. The property has guarded entrance gates and is patrolled for additional security.</p>

Walters had the 13.5-acre spread on and off the market for about three years starting in 2016, with asking prices that started out at a high of $85 million and dipped to a low of $48 million, but took it off the market before embarking on an extensive renovation.</p>

<p>By far the most expensive condo currently available on the open market in Los Angeles, the full-floor spread on the 39th floor&nbsp;of the Robert A.M. Stern-designed Century tower in Century City is on target to obliterate the standing record for the highest amount ever paid for a condo in Los Angeles, which is the $34.8 million Candy Spelling paid for her supersized duplex penthouse directly upstairs back in 2010.</p>
<p>Newly&nbsp;<a class="link " href="https://bachiroueida.elliman.com/sales/detail/512-l-564-81_23-247789/1-w-century-dr-century-city-los-angeles-ca-90067" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ylk="slk:listed on the open market;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">listed on the open market</a>&nbsp;with a head-turning $50 million price tag, the 9,400-square-foot mansion-in-the-sky has unobstructed views from the downtown skyline to the Hollywood sign to the Pacific Ocean. There are three ample bedrooms and three sumptuous bathrooms, plus four additional powder rooms, according to listings held by Bachir Oueida at Douglas Elliman.</p>

Walters hopes to more than double the $22.5 million that records show was paid for the condo in 2015.</p>
<p>Purchased as raw space, Walters had the condo decked out by Matthew Boland of&nbsp;<a class="link " href="https://www.mmbstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" data-ylk="slk:MMB Studio;elm:context_link;itc:0;sec:content-canvas">MMB Studio</a>&nbsp;in a style that shimmers with cosmopolitan opulence. Among the customizations is a heavy-duty HVAC system that keeps the whole place chilled to around 60 degrees so that the fresh flowers stay fresh longer. And in the foyer, where the ceiling glows with 22-carat gold leafing, an array of leaf-shaped Lalique light fixtures that adorn the glossy fumed Eucalyptus wood walls automatically light up when the elevator arrives.</p>
